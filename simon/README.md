This past weekend I was SO fortunate to compete in the Madison Startup Weekend, and DANG it was an incredible time! I created and introduced an idea for a platform where travel enthusiasts are held accountable for budgeting for their various travels. The goal is to get people out of their "Oh it's too hard to save for travel" slump and allow a convenient and fun way to invest in their future trips. The idea is that people have motivation to travel, but life tends to get in the way, a lot. My INCREDIBLE team Leong Qi Wei, Meredith Rolen and I developed a front end prototype and created a business model, cash-flow chart, launch plan, and initial marketing campaign for the platform "TripTime" in just under 50 hours after meeting for the first time. It was a great experience and I met some of the cooooolllest people. Oh, and the judges awarded us first place!!!! Woo! :D
